# Exploring greenhouse gas emissions database of provinces and territories in Canada

In this notebook, I explore greenhouse gas emissions database of all provinces and terittories in Canada using Python SQLite3 module. The particular skills include: 

- Using foundational SQL statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
- Filtering result and data using WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, MAX, LIKE, and LIMIT 
- Working with table: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, JOIN, PRGAMA and load tables 
- Using string patterns and ranges: ORDER and GROUP and built-in database functions 
- Accessing databases with SQL, Python, and create plots using seaborn library (Jupyter notebook)

Here is the link to download the dataset used in this notebook.
